# C++ Practice Problems
Created some C++ problems with solutions for students and people aspiring to be programmers.

How to do these exercises:
1. Extract the .zip file.
2. Open the "Problem" file.
3. Open the "Answer Here" file.
4. Try to solve the problem.
5. If you get stuck, you may open the "Hint" file.
* Please note that not every problem will include a "Hint" file. 
6. Please only open the "Solution" file only if you are totally stuck with the problem and cannot think of any other way to solve the code.

So, the order of files opened would be "Problem" -> "Answer Here" -> "Hint" -> "Solution".

Good luck!
